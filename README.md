# juju-inspect

Juju inspect is intended to analyse engine reports from a Juju controller. You
can feed it multiple engine reports and it will tell you various information
about the state of the controllers.

### Run

Running it is extremely simple:

```sh
go run main.go report_1 report_2 report_3
```

The output should be something like:

```sh
